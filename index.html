                   An app that you can use in the classroom in order to better help you
                   keep a quiet enviroment. Familiar Pokemon faces will come out to help
                   you delight students and surprise them.

            <h2>How to?</h2>
                <P>
                    Just keep the app open. It automatically detects the sound level in the room.
                    The longer the room stays quiet the more Pokemon will come out and the more 
                    rare they will get. If the level of noise increases the Pokemons will go away
                    and hide.

                   For teachers and students alike. Teachers have the benefit of using Pokemons to help them
                   keep the room quiet. Students can also sign up as students and collect Pokemons from teachers the more
                   quiet they stay in class.
