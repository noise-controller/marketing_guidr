            <h2> World's Most Important Game</h2>
            <p class="date">FEBURARY 10, 2018</p>
            <p>Pokémon GO is one of the most successful mobile games of all time, breaking records like fastest to earn
                $100 million and most-downloaded in its first month of release. To date, it has grossed almost $2
                billion in revenue and been downloaded 800 million times. Although no longer the global phenomenon it
                was in 2016, the game remains incredibly popular.</p>

            <p>I'm one of many people who still plays Pokémon GO. I'm not ashamed to admit being a bit addicted (I just
                hit level 40). And while some friends mock me for playing a "kid's game", that ridicule is often based
                on not really understanding why Pokémon GO is so appealing or what makes it special: innovative,
                award-winning gameplay mechanics that use Augmented Reality (AR) technology -- superimposing
                computer-generated information over your physical surroundings -- to put virtual creatures at real-world
                locations.</p>

            <p> Pokémon GO is the world's most important game. Thanks to its success, it will almost certainly influence
                the design of future AR experiences for years to come. But the game could also have a broader impact on
                society through its potential health benefits. This article covers the science behind five ways the game
                is good for you.</p>

            <h2> Pokémon Go Takes The World By Storm</h2>
            <p class="date">AUGUST 2, 2016</p>
            <p>A few weeks ago, if you saw someone wandering around your neighborhood staring at their phone, you might
                have assumed they were lost. Now, it would not be too much of a stretch to think that they are busy
                locating, capturing, battling or training fictional creatures called Pokémon. Welcome to Pokémon Go, the
                free-to-play location-based augmented reality game that has taken the world by storm since its release
                on July 6. For those that are unfamiliar with the Pokémon brand and wondering what the latest hoopla is
                all about, here is a brief rundown.</p>

            <p>Pokémon first emerged in 1995 as a Nintendo video game. Through the decades, it has grown into a massive
                franchise, which includes trading card games, animated movies and television shows, toys, and comics.
                While popular, it was primarily aimed at children and nostalgic adults who played the game when they
                were young. Ironically, the idea of creating the augmented reality game that has made Pokémon a
                household name came from an April Fool’s joke.</p>


            <p>On April 1, 2014, Google Inc. announced “Pokémon Masters,” an app that would allow people to hunt the
                monsters using Google Maps. Though just a prank, the ensuing enthusiasm caught the attention of San
                Francisco-based startup Niantic Labs and its founder, John Hanke. The team, whose first augmented
                reality mobile app game, Ingress, has been downloaded more than 12 million times, decided to turn
                Google’s prank into a reality by partnering with Nintendo to create Pokémon Go.</p>

            <p>Similar to previous Pokémon games, players travel the world to capture and battle the monsters in their
                quest to become the greatest Pokémon trainers. However, while the trips in the previous games were
                imaginary and conducted within the confines of a room, Pokémon Go forces players to get off their chairs
                and venture outside. That’s because the game uses the phone’s GPS and camera to help players “find”
                Pokemon in the real world, as well as discover various landmarks or Pokéstops, which offer items and
                experience points. This could mean finding a Rattata in your backyard, a Pidgey around the block, or a
                Pokéstop at your favorite neighborhood ice cream parlor.</p>

            <h2> WHAT WILL COME OF POKÉMON GO?</h2>
            <p class="date">25 JUL 2016</p>
            <p>Instead of taking big screens across the country by storm, this summer’s blockbuster has people glued to
                much smaller ones.</p>

            <p>Launched at the beginning of July by San Francisco-based software development company Niantic, Inc.,
                Pokémon Go has quickly become one of the most popular smartphone apps of all time. Data analytics firm
                Similar Web reported that in its first week alone, the app had been installed on nearly 11 percent of
                all android phones in the United States and surpassed Twitter’s daily usage shortly thereafter.</p>

            <p>Beyond being a viral sensation, the app’s success has striking implications for a number of industries,
                according to Willy Shih, the Robert and Jane Cizik Professor of Management Practice in Business
                Administration at Harvard Business School, who spent 28 years at IBM, Digital Equipment, Silicon
                Graphics, Eastman Kodak, and Thomson SA before coming to HBS in 2007. A member of the School’s
                Technology and Operations Management unit, Shih closely studies disruptive technology and technological
                strategy and took time to analyze the Pokémon Go phenomenon below.</p>

            <strong>What does Pokémon Go’s success mean for augmented reality going forward? Is AR the next big
                thing?</strong>

            <p>Willy Shih: Microsoft Windows users in the late 80s and early 90s might remember that Microsoft came up
                with a solitaire game as a way of introducing people to how to use a mouse. I think Pokémon Go is going
                to have the same effect, albeit unintended, of educating people about augmented reality. It’s a very
                clever introduction to the technology and beautifully illustrates the merging of the cyber and the
                physical. We’ve seen other things work similarly before—Google Glass, and heads-up displays in aircraft
                and high-end cars—but those only caught on in limited ways. Whereas they superimposed information on top
                of what you were already seeing, Pokémon Go superimposes geospacial information in an integrated way,
                allowing the game creators to put these monsters in exact locations and in physical spots of
                significance. That’s really quite different.</p>

            <strong>If you were in charge, how would you monetize Pokémon Go?</strong>

            <p>WS: With so many people looking for spots to collect these things, the platform’s ability to pull
                traffic to particular locations is innovative and completely unique, and represents a huge financial
                opportunity. It was just announced, for example, that McDonald’s is going to sponsor the game’s rollout
                in Japan. I imagine it could fundamentally change the face of things like sponsorship and mobile
                advertising. We haven’t begun to see the most outrageous applications of this yet.</p>

            <h2> Pokémon Go is Not Dead. It's Helping People.</h2>
            <p class="date">April 5, 2015</p>
            <p>Augmented reality game Pokémon Go has been downloaded more than 800m times, making it one of the most
                successful examples of location-based media to date. Although its popularity peaked and then plummeted
                in
                2016, it’s still being played by roughly 5m people all over the world on a daily basis – and our
                research
                shows it’s making a real difference to their lives.</p>

            <p> game blends physical space with digital information, turning players’ smart phone screens into a portal
                through which they can find and capture Pokémon, train them at gyms and visit PokéStops – all within
                their
                everyday environment.</p>

            <p>Older forms of location-based media, such as the 2004 game Mogi (where GPS tracking enabled players to
                collect virtual objects scattered around the streets) failed to withstand the test of time. But Pokémon
                Go
                is different. Its visually stimulating and innovative interface gives players a more immersive
                experience –
                and this kept them coming back.</p>

            <p>We wanted to understand how the game continues to affect these players lives: in particular, we wanted to
                know whether playing Pokémon Go pushes people to spend more time outside, experiment with different
                routes
                through their surroundings or interact socially with other players.</p>

            <p>So, between May and July 2017, we set up a 30-minute online survey. It was completed by 375 Pokémon Go
                users
                across the globe, primarily from the UK and US but also from Europe, Australia, the Middle East and
                Canada.
                In the context of 5m daily players, 375 may sound like a small sample. But the depth and richness of the
                data provided by these players, and the recurring themes we found across the sample, mean that we were
                able
                to extract an accurate set of findings about the motivations and behaviours of people who still play the
                game</p>
