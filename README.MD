This is a team effort project by Lamba Students `silvodesigns` and `JacobVanWormer`.


The task is to create a multi-marketing page for a ficticious noise cancelling app:

<b>PItch:</b> As a teacher, it can be hard to control the noise level in your classroom!
You need an app that holds kids attention, and is sensitive to the noise level in the room
to motivate them to stay quiet. While some exist, they seem to encourage kids to yell 
(like balls that bounce higher if you yell louder). This app will reveal unique animals 
(choose a theme for this app) only if it's quiet enough, keeping the kids quiet. 

As a theme for this concept app we chose Pokemon. Acting as a parody to the app Pokemong Go.

`We, silvodesigns & JacobVanWormer do not own any of the images used in this project. Nintendo and
the Pokemon company are the rightful owners of these images. We are only using theses images for educational
